  Hello there! At some point in your life, you must have downloaded a game and had gone “Wow! There is so much content it has to offer, I can’t even put it in words how fun it would be to play if I only had enough time (and/or money) to grind through the steep difficulty curve.”

You then pictured the vast expanse of creativity arrayed before you and the depths to which you could experience the plot or storyline behind your app, had you only possessed those marvellous hacking skills so often shown in Hollywood movies–the ability to materialize code and programs at the wave of a hand like a mage casting an arcane spell. I too recently had a similar epiphany. Having learned a few summers’ worth of coding, I decided to take up and face such a challenge head on, and develop my own software to open up the game for modification.

In the process, I have learned a lot, and felt that it was only right for me to share my experiences with everyone else on this blog, so as to let those who are interested have a simple, straightforward, and, hopefully, helpful guide to all the different varieties of anti-debugging techniques that I encountered.
